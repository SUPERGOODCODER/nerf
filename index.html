    <pre style="color:orange;text-align:center;font-size:30px;">Nerf is a toy brand formed by Parker 
Brothers and currently owned by Hasbro. Most of the toys are a variety of 
foam-based weaponry,
with other Nerf products including balls for sports such as American football,
basketball, and 
baseball. Their best known toys are their dart guns (referred to by Hasbro
 as "blasters") that shoot ammunition made from "Nerf foam" (partially reticulated
polyether type polyurethane foam).[1] Their primary slogan, 
first introduced in the 1990s, is "It's Nerf or Nothin'!". 
Annual revenues under the Nerf brand are approximately US$400 million.[2]
        
Parker Brothers originally developed Nerf, beginning with a 4-inch
(100 mm) polyurethane foam ball. In 1969, Reyn Guyer, a Minnesota-based
 games inventor, and Minnesota Vikings kicker Fred Cox came to the 
company with a football game that was safe for indoor play, and after
studying it carefully, Parker Brothers decided to eliminate everything
but the foam ball. In 1970, the Nerf ball was introduced as the "world's
first official indoor ball", the name "Nerf" being a slang term for the
foam padding used in off-roading.[3] Marketing slogans promised that one
can "Throw it indoors; you can't damage lamps or break windows. You can't
hurt babies or old people."[4] Some of the first TV commercials for the 
balls were joint promotions with General Foods' Kool-Aid drink mix, with 
Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones and Michael Nesmith of the Monkees playing with
the balls on a living room soundstage (Kool-Aid sponsored the 1969–70 
Saturday morning reruns of the Monkees' 1966–67 TV series). The ball
filled a strong consumer need and by the year's end, more than four 
million Nerf balls had been sold.[5] The 4-inch (100 mm) ball was
followed by a large version called the "Super Nerf Ball". Shortly
after, in 1972, a basketball game called "Nerfoop" and the Nerf 
football (developed by longtime NFL kicker Fred Cox[6][7]) joined
the family, with the latter quickly becoming Nerf's most popular 
ball.[8]
